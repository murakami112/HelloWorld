# HelloWorld
Hello Every one , I am Nilanjan from India, born and brought up in Bengal and currently in Bangalore, the silicon valley of India. I am a computer engineer, who has been dabbling with these fantastic machines for the last six years of my life. I really enjoy the subject, the way it brings so many things together, the joy of creating something, the beaty of mathematical logic, the oppurtunity to contribute in so many areas and the way it has created a global community of coders, programmers, gamers, scientists and so on.
 So now I am here to really create something wonderfull and hopefully may be able to make this world a little better place to live in.
